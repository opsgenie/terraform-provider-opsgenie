# opsgenie\_team

Manages a Team within Opsgenie.

  full_name = "name "
  role      = "User"
}

resource "opsgenie_user" "second" {

    role = "admin"
  }

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name associated with this team. Opsgenie defines that this must not be longer than 100 characters.

* `description` - (Optional) A description for this team.

* `ignore_members` - (Optional) Set to true to ignore any configured member blocks and any team member added/updated/removed via OpsGenie web UI. Use this option e.g. to maintain membership via web UI only and use it only for new teams. Changing the value for existing teams might lead to strange behaviour. Defaults to false.

* `delete_default_resources` - (Optional) Set to true to remove default escalation and schedule for newly created team. **Be careful its also changes that team routing rule to None. That means you have to define routing rule as well**


* `member` - (Optional) A Member block as documented below.

`member` supports the following:

* `id` - (Required) The UUID for the member to add to this Team.
* `role` - (Optional) The role for the user within the Team - can be either 'admin' or 'user', defaults to 'user' if not set.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Opsgenie Team.

## Import
